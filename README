FormIgniter v0.8 - http://formigniter.org
=============================================

Formigniter takes away the drudge work of building your forms. You can now go
on to build the more interesting custom elements, session controls and data manipulation.

INSTALL
-------

Copy the controller, view, models, libraries into your application directory of a CodeIgniter installation

Writting forms to files
-----------------------

If you want your built forms to be written to files please CHMOD the directory /forms at the base of the install.

Save statistics to a database
------------------------------

If you want to save a count of the number of forms built import the database schema from ./schema.sql

Change the constant DB in ./controllers/formigniter.php to TRUE.

TODO
-----

Added closing / to checkbox input field
Changed id to class for checkbox and radio fields

- Go through phpmyadmin and exclude field types which can't have a value/length

tinyint - yes max 255
text - no 
date - no 
smallint - yes max 255

datetime - no
timestamp - no

- Add support for form_name?? Questionable whether this is necessary

To Decide:

- Add support for 3 field date select boxes
- Add css class names to form and selects/checkboxes/radios when added
